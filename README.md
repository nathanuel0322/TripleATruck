## Triple A Mobile Gaming

<span style="color: orange;">ReactJS</span> site designed for the Triple A Mobile Gaming Business in Randolph, New Jersey. The site features a smooth slideshow using <span style="color: orange;">react-awesome-slider</span> for animations.
 that is mobile-responsive and a globally mobile-friendly design.

Moreover, the site is connected to <span style="color: orange;">Firebase Storage</span> for the business owners to easily add pictures to their slideshow using an API that I created. 

The site also includes usage of <span style="color: orange;">react-spring</span> for smooth pop-up animations.

Lastly, I implemented <span style="color: orange;">EmailJS</span> into a contact form to allow users to send emails to the business owners directly from the site and without having to make a phone call.
